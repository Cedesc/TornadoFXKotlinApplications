Should have:
    1. everything that the notes-app has
        - create items
        - check items with a click
        - one list for WW to Mainz and one list for Mainz to WW
        - a view to see all items
    2. different kinds of items
        - every time fix (like iPad)
        - every time optional (like ps4 games)
        - only once (like B12)
    3. note the items, that are checked, automatically for the return list (in own category?)
    4. groups of items / categories
    5. history
    6. list of clothes that are in Mainz


Plan:
    1. UML Diagram

        -CHECK- main view
        -CHECK- add item view
            -1- change the class of itemType to a better than just a string ?

        -3- to take view
    -CHECK- check out what to implement in controllers
    -3- make better views
    -2.5- create GUI tests (oh pls no...)
    -2- add a method to AbstractItem to add multiple categories at once?
    -2- add a method to drop a category
    -CHECK- add a constructor to AbstractItem to add categories at the beginning?
    -2- add a method to convert an item type to another
    -2- fill Category.kt
    -OBSOLETE- fill items.txt with ItemParser.kt
    -1- add history

Classes:
    AbstractItem
        EssentialItem - item which is (nearly) every time taken
        OptionalItem - item which is often taken
        OneTimeItem - item which is (nearly) only one time taken
    ShowedItem
    Category


Views:
    View 0 - Main Menu
    View 1 - Create New Item
    View 2 - See the full list of items (in a table to sort by categories, names, etc?)
