Should have:
    1. everything that the notes-app has
        - create items
        - check items with a click
        - one list for WW to Mainz and one list for Mainz to WW
        - a view to see all items
    2. different kinds of items
        - every time fix (like iPad)
        - every time optional (like ps4 games)
        - only once (like B12)
    3. note the items, that are checked, automatically for the return list (in own category?)
    4. groups of items / categories
    5. history
    6. list of clothes that are in Mainz


Plan:
    1. UML Diagram
    2. find out where to implement the classes
    3. implement the classes


Classes:
    AbstractItem
        EssentialItem - item which is (nearly) every time taken
        OptionalItem - item which is often taken
        OneTimeItem - item which is (nearly) only one time taken
    ShowedItem
    Category


Views:
    View 0 - Main Menu
    View 1 - Create New Item
    View 2 - See the full list of items (in a table to sort by categories, names, etc?)
    View 3 - See the full list of items, that I will take


Further:
    - lorem ipsum
