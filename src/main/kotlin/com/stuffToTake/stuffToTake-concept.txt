Should have:
    1. everything that the notes-app has
        - create items
        - check items with a click
        - one list for WW to Mainz and one list for Mainz to WW
        - a view to see all items
    2. different kinds of items
        - every time fix (like iPad)
        - every time optional (like ps4 games)
        - only once (like B12)
    3. note the items, that are checked, automatically for the return list (in own category?)
    4. groups of items / categories
    5. history
    6. list of clothes that are in Mainz



TornadoFX Source Code: https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx/tree/master/src/main/java/tornadofx

To Do List:
    -4- Implement the finish method in ToTakeController and the markedAsToTake() / unmarkedAsToTake()
    -4- Make the savings meaningful (not everytime the app is closed)
    -3- views
        -3- add item view
            -3- make color changing buttons instead of checkboxes
            -1- make javafx ListView to tornadofx listview ? (why?)
            -1- change the class of itemType to a better than just a string ? (It works fine as it is)
            -1- radio buttons instead of a view list for categories ? (It works fine as it is)
        -2- list of items view
            -2- add search bar for searching by name or by category
            -1- deactivate sort by category or make it meaningful
        -2- item list for choosing
            -1- disable the blue bar on selection
        -2- to take view
            -2- items disappear or pushed to the end when they're clicked

                https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx/wiki/Utilities
        -3- history view
    -3- make better views

            [useful keywords:
            fontWeight, fontSize, fontFamily, c(), textFill, backgroundColor, backgroundInsets, multi(Color...)
            padding, borderColor, rotate, hover, mixin (for reusing, so for "create stylesheet...")]
        -3- create stylesheet for repetitive styles of components
        -2- more colors / dark mode
    -2.5- create GUI tests (oh pls no...)
    -2- in EditItemView make it possible to change the identical item in the other list too
    -2- make it impossible to add two identical items to itemsList
    -1- simpler method to change the amount of clothing stuff
    -1- when an item is added to ItemsList it generates the whole observableShowItems list -> performance problems?
    -1- add a method to convert an item type to another (isn't necessary instead delete the old one and add the new one)
    -1- add image to item and show it tiny in the list
