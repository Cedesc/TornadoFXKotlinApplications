Should have:
    1. everything that the notes-app has
        - create items
        - check items with a click
        - one list for WW to Mainz and one list for Mainz to WW
        - a view to see all items
    2. different kinds of items
        - every time fix (like iPad)
        - every time optional (like ps4 games)
        - only once (like B12)
    3. note the items, that are checked, automatically for the return list (in own category?)
    4. groups of items / categories
    5. history
    6. list of clothes that are in Mainz



TornadoFX Source Code: https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx/tree/master/src/main/java/tornadofx

To Do List:
    -4- to avoid confusion, add a "Back" Button to the Edit Items View
    -4- move "toMainzitems.txt" and "toWWItems.txt" to OneDrive, so I don't have to commit and push everytime I use the
        app
    -4- history should be added to git
    -4- fill with meaningful items (look over them) and delete allTo...Items
    -4- Work through the To-Do's
    -4- Implement the finish method in ToTakeController and the markedAsToTake() / unmarkedAsToTake()
    -4- Make the savings meaningful (not everytime the app is closed)
    -4- make it possible to see the history in app
    -3- added search function for the history to search after an item whether it is in Mainz or WW
    -3- make it impossible to add an item that is already in the list
    -3- views
        -3- add item view
            -3- make color changing buttons instead of checkboxes
            -1- make javafx ListView to tornadofx listview ? (why?)
            -1- change the class of itemType to a better than just a string ? (It works fine as it is)
            -1- radio buttons instead of a view list for categories ? (It works fine as it is)
        -2- list of items view
            -2- add search bar for searching by name or by category
            -1- deactivate sort by category or make it meaningful
        -2- item list for choosing
            -1- disable the blue bar on selection
        -2- to take view
            -2- items disappear or pushed to the end when they're clicked

                https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx/wiki/Utilities
        -3- history view
    -3- make better views
            https://docs.tornadofx.io/0_subsection/6_css
            [useful keywords:
            fontWeight, fontSize, fontFamily, c(), textFill, backgroundColor, backgroundInsets, multi(Color...)
            padding, borderColor, rotate, hover, mixin (for reusing, so for "create stylesheet...")]
        -3- create stylesheet for repetitive styles of components
        -2- more colors / dark mode
    -2.5- create GUI tests (oh pls no...)
    -2- change the comparison of two items to compare both names including the item type (first line of toString())
        instead of the full string (simple but unlikely problem of the current implementation: if 3 sport trousers are
        an optional item, the 2 sport trousers in the other list won't be changed)
    -2- in EditItemView make it possible to change the identical item in the other list too
    -2- make it impossible to add two identical items to itemsList
    -1- simpler method to change the amount of clothing stuff
    -1- when an item is added to ItemsList it generates the whole observableShowItems list -> performance problems?
    -1- add a method to convert an item type to another (isn't necessary instead delete the old one and add the new one)
    -1- add image to item and show it tiny in the list
